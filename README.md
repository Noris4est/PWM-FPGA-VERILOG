In this project, I am developing a PWM parametric module. It allows you to adjust the frequency / period of the PWM signal, change the maximum number of duty cycle (FILL_FACTOR), but requires setting the frequency of the input signal IN_CLOCK. The edge of the IN_RESET signal updates the duty cycle. (FILL_FACTOR), which is read from the IN_FILL_FACTOR port. The output signal is nonzero only if IN_ENABLE = 1. The duration of the IN_RESET signal does not matter, because the sensitivity of the module to the leading edge of this signal.
